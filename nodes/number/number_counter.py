#: ``node id -> its current count``, for the lifetime of the process. v2 kept this on the
#: node instance ComfyUI caches per graph node, so a count lasted as long as the server ran
#: and started over on the next one. ``execute`` runs on a per-execution clone of the class,
#: which is discarded afterwards and cannot hold it, and a module attribute is what has the
#: same lifetime. Nothing is written to disk: a count keyed on a graph node id would
#: otherwise outlive the workflow that made it and be picked up by whatever numbered a node
#: the same way next.
