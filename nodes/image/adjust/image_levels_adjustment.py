    Args:
        image: Source PIL image.
        black_level: Input level that becomes black, 0-255.
        mid_level: Input level that becomes mid grey, 0-255. At or below ``black_level``

    Returns:
        A PIL image the same size and mode as the source.

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: ``white_level`` equals ``black_level``, so the stretch divides
            by a zero range; or ``mid_level`` sits exactly on ``white_level``, which puts
            the gamma denominator on ``log(1)``.
        ValueError: ``white_level`` is below ``black_level``, which makes the gamma ratio
            negative and takes the logarithm out of its domain.
