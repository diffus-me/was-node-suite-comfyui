#: Frames either side the reference may be averaged over. A wider window is what flattens a
#: slower drift, and it is the only control that does: two passes of a narrow window land where
#: one pass of a window twice as wide lands, for twice the work. The padding it adds costs two
#: quantile curves per frame, a few hundred kilobytes at this ceiling, so the bound is on what a
#: sequence can usefully be averaged across rather than on what fits in memory.
